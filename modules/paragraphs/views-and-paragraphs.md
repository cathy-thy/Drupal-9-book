# Views and Paragraphs

It's simple to use views with normal fields; however, story may get complicated when you have paragraph field in your content type. In this case, with the help of REST Views [https://www.drupal.org/project/rest\_views](https://www.drupal.org/project/rest\_views), we are able to serialize the paragraph field.

But if you are not happy with the format generated by the views or you want more control on the format, you may try [custom-restful-api](../../custom-modules/custom-restful-api/ "mention").

#### 1. Download and enable module
