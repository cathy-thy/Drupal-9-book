# hook\_ENTITY\_TYPE\_update

hook\_ENTITY\_TYPE\_update is one of the hooks available in Drupal. It is powerful as it covers different "ENTITY\_TYPE".

In Drupal, multiple things are classified as entity type, such as user, content (node), taxonomy...

Here, I use node as an example. By using "hook\_ENTITY\_TYPE\_update", I wish to print a custom message.
